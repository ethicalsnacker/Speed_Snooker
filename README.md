# Speed_Snooker
Python based shot timer using Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth remotes. 

## Brief

Like the TV format of speed snooker with shot timer. The project has these requirements... 

1. Frame time; Unsure so to set at 30, 20, 15 as we're not professionals!
2. 15 second shot time until the last 5 minutes, this then becomes 10 seconds at that point.
3. Each last 5 seconds of the timer has to have a beep code sounded out with long beep at the end.
4. Needs to be controlled easily (Bluetooth or IR remotes)
